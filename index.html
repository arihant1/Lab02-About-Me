          I am originally from Puerto Rico, but I was raised primarily in South
          Florida. Growing up I had the opportunity to live in both countries. I
          am grateful to have learned both English and Spanish from a very young
          age and experience two different cultures.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutText">
          Towards the end of the summer of 2009, I enlisted In the U.S. Army
          where I served two enlistments totaling in 6 years. During that time,
          I was fortunate enough to travel to a number of places including
          Afghanistan. Through these experiences, I learned many life skills
          that I will value for years to come.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutText">
          After the military, I relocated to Atlanta to pursue my education. I
          started in business but quickly realized that the subject was not
          something I was passionate about. I later discovered that I really
          enjoyed being creative, and I liked the idea of learning something
          that would keep me on my toes. After digging into different fields, I
          made a match with web development. Iâ€™m currently a student web
          developer with focus in frontend work, but I am interested in dabbling
          with anything and everything!
